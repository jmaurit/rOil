notes on ifn presentation

Slide 1

Huge litterature on oil production, optimal extraction
	-from both geo-engineering and economics litterature. 
	-But there is a big gap and it is especially important now.  
	-The effect of oil prices on production from existing fields
		-In mature areas, like Norway most production is coming from existing fields

slide 2
Empirical litterature you have several papers estimating the effect of drilling and reserve replacement
	- finding 
	- especially for Norwegian data.  

Studies of aggregate production also exist - 
	- some from curve-fitting/simulation
	- Hubberts peak type modesl.  Can generate decent forecasts, but are not particularily informative. 
	- Some econometric models also exist of total production 
	- but these do not tell you much about where the change in price is coming from.  
	- In addition a lot of the modeling is questionable.  Ramcharran - revenue targeting by opec producers.  


1. Challenge have been two-fold, 
	-lack of available data 
	-lack of a flexible enough model.  Production profile over time is a highly non-linear and not well approximated by standard parametric models.  

But I have gotten around these two challenges.
1. I use detailed Norwegian data on field-level production from all 77 oil-producing fields in Norway
2. I use a semi-parametric model within the Generalized Additive Model framework.  
	-here I use a 2 dimensional non-parametric function to control for the shape of oil fields and estimate the effect of price parametrically.  
Warn you, I wont go into 

Main results is to say that oil price has only a modest effect on field level production
- It has no signficant concurrent effect
- only a slight lagged effect, on the magnitude of a 2- 4 % increase for a 10 $ increase in prices
- Shows is that oil producers are not using production to be strategic - they are pumping the full amount given their current capacity and using storage or more likely financial markets to hedge price movements. 
- A sustained change in prices effects only production by way of lifting constraints and leading to more investment - which I also have evidence for. 
- None of this is probably that surprising - it is extremely expensive to be operating out in the north sea - you are not keeping spare capacity just sitting out there. 



Slide  Oil fields in north sea
Here you can clearly see what is called creaming - the biggest fields are found first. 
- one notable exception, which I have added to the data here is the Johan Sverdrup oil field which was recently found and is still under development


Slide Oil fields in norwegian sea
The Norwegian sea was opened up to exploration later, and there were quite high expectations when it did, but it has generally been a dissapointment with few finds.  



Slide Total oil production
-Shows total norwegian oil production
-See the top was in the year 2000, coincidentally that was the time with some of the lowest prices.
This is a problem - as you can see oil prices are autocorrelated, and as you can see from this slide, so is oil field production - the production profiles tend to be correlated - here the 10 largest oil fields in Norway.  

This means, it is really easy to get some spurious inference, even with standard methods like differencing and with differencing you are also throwing away a lot of your data.  


Slide x
-I just took the largest 10 Norwegian fields in terms of total production, and here I show one of the problems with estimating the effect of price.  
- production profiles are correlated between fields and so you get a bell-shaped total production field - which is what these early geo-engineering studies made use of to predict total production.  
-you can get spurious correlation because both production and oil prices are autocorrelated.  

Slide 4.  
I can demonstrate the danger here by running a regular GLM model like this where I try to model the production profile by cubic functions for up to the peak and from the peak on.  I control for size of the find and I throw in price and its lags

slide statfjord
taking the example of the field Statfjord (though keep in mind Im not modeling them independently but all the fields simultaneously trying to get a general shape)

Slide: result negative result

Slide: instead we need a more flexible approach - that is where our generalized additive model comes in.  

Slide:  
-split up and estimate a series of linear models in each section - a cubic is common, then tie them together at places appropriately called knots and then in addition you adjust the smoother by adding a penalty function - a second derivative of the estimated function to controll for smoothness. 

Slide: Estimate model

Slide: Use of thin plate spline

slide: splitting up in small and large fields - but also helps interpretation

slide: Only slight lagged effects - consistent with the idea that they are not producing strategically, but instead you can see a price rise as a loosening of production constraint - they will invest more to increase production - either to shift the time profile of production or to increase the the total resource.   

slide:  One implication of this is you would expect to see an effect on investment at the oil field levels.  This I have data for and can check.

As a concluding idea, and at this point only for illustration
