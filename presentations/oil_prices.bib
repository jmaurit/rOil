	abstract = {The present paper reviews the reactions and the path of acceptance of the theory known as “peak oil”. The theory was proposed for the first time by M.K. Hubbert in the 1950s as a way to describe the production pattern of crude oil. According to Hubbert, the production curve is “bell shaped” and approximately symmetric. Hubbert's theory was verified with good approximation for the case of oil production in the United States that peaked in 1971, and is now being applied to the worldwide oil production. It is generally believed that the global peak of oil production (“peak oil”) will take place during the first decade of the 21st century, and some analysts believe that it has already occurred in 2005 or 2006. The theory and its consequences have unpleasant social and economical implications. The present paper is not aimed at assessing the peak date but offers a discussion on the factors that affect the acceptance and the diffusion of the concept of “peak oil” with experts and with the general public. The discussion is based on a subdivision of “four stages of acceptance”, loosely patterned after a sentence by Thomas Huxley.},

However, the assumptions of the Hubbert method have never been rigorously tested with a large, publicly available data set. In this paper, three assumptions of the modern Hubbert theory are tested using data from 139 oil producing regions. These regions are sub-national (United States state-level, United States regional-level), national, and multi-national (subcontinental and continental) in scale. We test the assumption that oil production follows a bell-shaped curve by generating best-fitting curves for each region using six models and comparing the quality of fit across models. We also test the assumptions that production over time in a region tends to be symmetric, and that production is more bell-shaped in larger regions than in smaller regions.},

The following types of models are reviewed: the Hubbert method; other curve-fitting methods such as exponential and Gaussian models; simulation models of resource discovery and extraction; and data-rich “bottom-up” models. Economic models are reviewed more briefly. Forty-five mathematical models of oil depletion of the last century are classified along four dimensions of variability: emphasis on physical or economic aspects of oil production; model scale; hypothetical or mechanistic orientation; and complexity. Models based on quite disparate assumptions (e.g., physical simulation vs. economic optimal depletion) have produced approximately bell-shaped production profiles, but data do not support assertions that any one model type is most useful for forecasting future oil production. In fact, evidence suggests that existing models have fared poorly in predicting global oil production. The greatest promise for future developments in oil depletion modeling lies in simulation models that combine both physical and economic aspects of oil production.},

We find strong evidence for changes in persistence and in volatility of price across three well defined periods. We argue that historically, the real price of oil has tended to be highly persistent and volatile whenever rapid industrialization in a major world economy coincided with uncertainty regarding access to supply. We present a modified commodity storage model that fully incorporates demand, and further can accommodate both transitory and permanent shocks. We show that the role of storage when demand is subject to persistent growth shocks is speculative, instead of its classic mitigating role. This result helps to account for the increased volatility of oil price we observe in these periods.},

	abstract = {Departing from Hotelling’s assumption of fixed and known reserves, this paper develops an economic model of additions to proven reserves that explicitly incorporates the effects of expected resource price, cumulative reserves development, and technological progress on reserve additions. The model treats additions to proven oil reserves as output of a production process in which drilling wells is a primary input to transform some of oil-in-place into the economic category of proven reserves. Application of the model to {US} data for the 1950–1995 period provides strong statistical support for the existence of all the three salient effects. We obtain an estimate of the price elasticity of reserve additions (absent from previous studies) which, although statistically highly significant, is rather small. Using this price elasticity estimate, it is shown that if in the face of steady economic growth, and hence, oil consumption, {US} oil import dependence is to be kept from rising in the future, ceteris paribus, a steady oil price increase in the range of 1.5–4.5\% a year is essential.},

We investigate whether production cuts or increases by {OPEC} and non {OPEC} members are based on their investment or budgetary needs. By retesting the {TR} model, we show that investment and budgetary needs do not affect the production of oil in free-market economies ({OPEC} and non-{OPEC}), but they do affect production decisions of the more centrally-planned, isolated and oil dependent economies. Existing studies in the literature have conceptual and statistical limitations that justify retesting the model. This study is the first to investigate the {TR} model in a separate study and to compare the results of static and dynamic models. It is also the first to examine the relationship between the degree of economic freedom and the Target Revenue model and to note the {TR} model is stable when used for countries that are price takers.},

In 2001, Norway reached its peak production and began to decline.

The Norwegian oil production can be broken up into four subclasses; giant oil fields, smaller oil fields, natural gas liquids and condensate. The production of each subclass was analyzed to find typical behaviour and decline rates. The typical decline rates of giant oil fields were found to be −13\% annually. The other subclasses decline equally fast or even faster, especially condensate with typical decline rates of −40\% annually. The conclusion from the forecast is that Norway will have dramatically reduced export volume of oil by 2030.},

Over 50\% of the world’s oil production came from giants by 2005 and more than half of the world’s ultimate reserves are found in giants. Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the future development of the giant oil fields will have a significant impact on the world oil supply. In order to better understand the giant fields and their future behavior, one must first understand their history. This study has used a comprehensive database on giant oil fields in order to determine their typical parameters, such as the average decline rate and life-times of giants. The evolution of giant oil field behavior has been investigated to better understand future behavior. One conclusion is that new technology and production methods have generally led to high depletion rates and rapid decline. The historical trend points towards high decline rates of fields currently on plateau production. The peak production generally occurs before half the ultimate reserves have been produced in giant oil fields. A strong correlation between depletion-at-peak and average decline rate is also found, verifying that high depletion rate leads to rapid decline. Our result also implies that depletion analysis can be used to rule out unrealistic production expectations from a known reserve, or to connect an estimated production level to a needed reserve base.},

	abstract = {Reserve replacement remains a key challenge for the international oil and gas companies. As market-oriented oil and gas provinces are maturing, exploration activity is shifted towards the resource-rich, regulated regimes outside the {OECD}. Regulated oil and gas provinces remain under-explored also in econometric terms. In this paper, we specify and estimate an econometric model of exploration and appraisal drilling for the highly regulated Norwegian Continental Shelf ({NCS}) over the period 1965 to 2004. Explanatory variables include the oil price, cumulative discoveries and open exploration acreage. Estimated error-correction models account explicitly for sluggishness and short-term adjustments in exploration drilling. We find robust long-term oil price effects on exploration activity, whereas the short-term response is muted. On the other hand, the temporary influence on exploration drilling from licensing rounds for new exploration acreage is significant, and so are the feedback effects from historical exploration success. At the same time, the longer-term impact of these variables is more moderate.},

The sample period, unlike Griffin's, however, includes phases of price increase (1970s) and price decrease (1980s–1990s), thus providing a better framework for examining production behavior using the competitive model. The {OPEC} results do not support the competitive hypothesis; instead, a negative and significant price elasticity of supply is obtained. This result offers partial support for the target revenue theory. For most of the non-{OPEC} members, the estimates support the competitive model. {OPEC}'s loss of market share and the drop in the share of oil-based energy should signal adjustments in price and quantity based on a competitive world market for crude oil.},

The analysis is based on an after-tax investment model in which number of wells drilled and exploration risk are endogenous variables. The model is solved using 1) the values of the relevant tax parameters specified by the tax code and 2) empirical estimates of the non-tax parameters and exogenous variables. The analysis shows that the alternative minimum tax has reduced by 9\% the optimal number of exploration wells as compared to the optimal number of exploration wells prior to the introduction of the alternative minimum tax. The analysis also shows that the alternative minimum tax has 1) reduced the optimal level of exploration risk and 2) increased the importance of well-designed incentive compensation agreements for firms operating in the extractive petroleum industry.},

We are able to control for heterogeneity in the data by incorporating variables which account for both the geological features of each field and individual operator characteristics. The results indicate that the expected price of oil and the level of reserves are important in influencing the appraisal duration but that the variance of the oil price is not. Variables capturing the non-economic features of the individual fields are also found to be significant factors affecting the appraisal lag.},

Concern about the effect of this dependence on economic and national security has focused attention on the domestic resource base: how much oil awaits discovery and at what rate can it be produced? We analyze the adequacy of domestic resources by updating and modifying in important new ways the models of discovery and production developed by M. King Hubbert. Hubbert's models have been a lightning rod for debate about the future of oil resources because they have been the most accurate on record. When we include real oil prices and the annual rate of drilling effort in Hubbert's model of oil discovery, there is no evidence for claims that the secular decline in discoveries per foot of well drilled has been arrested or reversed in the lower forty-eight states. Our results indicate that there is little oil waiting to be found in unexplored sedimentary formations in the lower forty-eight states using conventional exploration techniques. Furthermore, we show that the declining quality of the resource base has offset the positive stimuli of price increases and changes in government policy towards a free market. Having passed through a period in which production in the lower forty-eight states fell 20 percent while real oil prices tripled there seems little that the U.S. government can do to alter the bottom line for domestic operators so that U.S. production can displace imports to a significant degree. We conclude that the conventional supply side offers little room to manoeuvre around increased dependence on imported oil.},

	abstract = {Exploration for oil or gas reserves consists of searching for and finding new reserves. It begins with the study of the geology of an area followed by exploratory or wildcat drilling in promising areas. How much oil or gas is found or the supply of new reserves is a function of exploration, the geology of the area drilled along with a random component measuring the fickleness of mother nature in yielding up her treasures to mere mortals. Knowing how oil and gas prices affect this process (price elasticities) is valuable to those who are involved with this strategic industry. Economic theory suggests that the search for petroleum is affected by prices and can be characterized by functions representing geophysical activities and drilling while the finding of reserves can be characterized by some sort of discovery process. The earliest econometric approach to modeling oil and gas exploration, which yielded price elasticities, was to estimate the search process using a function for wildcat wells drilled (Ww). For example, the discovery process for oil was represented using two equations: a success rate equation \% of wells that are commercially successful (W/Ww) and an average oil reserve per successful well equation (O/W). Each of these three dependent variables were dependent on price and other relevant variables. The product of these three variables (Ww∗W/Ww∗O/W) yields the supply of oil reserves (O). In this paper we survey all U.S. exploration models for oil and gas that include wells drilled, share of successful wells, average reserves per well, or total reserve equations. We focus our survey on price elasticities to capture the effect of market price on the exploration process. Drilling equation results tend to be good with drilling strongly influenced by oil price and we suspect the long run drilling oil price elasticity to be greated than 1. It is much less clear how natural gas prices have affected drilling but their effect seems to be increasing. The most important issue in drilling equations besides including the correct economic variables is more work to clarify what geological variables provide the best forecasts. The econometric estimates for successful wells and average reserves per wells are much poorer and we would recommend more systematic work on discovery models to determine which perform the best.},

However, such a conclusion may be premature. While the average success rate for the industry is substantially higher, the success rate for a group of large technologically progressive producers including Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron, and Texaco was only marginally higher in 1998 than in 1978. Building on the work of Forbes and Zampelli (2000) that examined the impact of technology on the offshore success rate, this paper develops an econometric model that attempts to disentangle and quantify the effects of the major factors hypothesized to affect the onshore exploratory success rate. The analysis relies on a panel of company level data from the Energy Information Administration’s Financial Reporting System ({FRS}).},

We estimate a vector error correction model for oil production in the lower 48 states that specifies real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing by the Texas Railroad Commission. These modifications enable us to generate a model that accounts for most of the variation in oil production in the lower 48 states between 1938 and 1991. The result that oil production in the lower 48 states shares stochastic trends with real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing indicates that accuracy of Hubbert's bell shaped curve is fortuitous. The importance of these factors also indicates why the basic Hotelling model cannot replicate the production path for oil in the lower 48 states. This inability is critical. The negative economic effects associated with high prices and energy shortages imply that the importance of inconsistencies with the basic Hotelling model identified by this analysis may be sufficient to warrant a greater degree of government intervention in the transition from oil than is currently envisioned by most policy makers.},

Empirical models of exploration-discovery and of drilling cost are used to assess the effect of technological change at both the field level and the regional level. Our results indicate that technological change played a very significant role in the offshore industry over the past 50 years, increasing reserves and lowering cost. Although depletion effect was dominant over the first two decades, the effect of technological change was able to offset that of resource depletion over the entire 50-year study period.},

The emphasis of the paper is on econometric and forecasting issues, and it discusses alternative methods of estimating Hubbert's model. Using data on oil production in the U.S. lower 48 states, the paper reports the results of estimating the various specifications of the model and its extensions by the maximum-likelihood method, and provides the implied estimates for ultimate resource recovery and their associated standard errors. When economic factors are taken into account the estimates of ultimate resource recovery become state-dependent, and we find that in this case the estimates are higher than those obtained from the various specifications of Hubbert's original model. Although the accuracy of the estimates of ultimate recoverable reserves cannot be evaluated before oil reserves are actually exhausted, we examine how the various models estimated over the periods 1926–1985 and 1948–1985 perform in predicting oil production over the 1986–1990 period.},

King Hubbert’s oil production and discovery forecasting model (Hubbert, 1962), using a non–time–series cumulative discovery and production quadratic Hubbert curve and structural shift variables to model technology and regulation changes. The model can be used to determine better world oil supplies. Price is tested, to see how powerful it is for increasing or decreasing oil supply. Using a trend of cumulative production, instead of time, will help to better fix the supply elasticity with respect to price, which is shown to be very inelastic. An interesting question is whether cumulative discovery or production constitutes an I(2) variable. This paper explains that they are not I(2) variables.},

This paper concerns crude oil reserve appreciation in both the {UK} and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. It examines the change in reserves attributed to North Sea fields over time, seeking to reveal patterns of reserve appreciation both for individual fields and for groups of fields classified by potentially relevant common elements. These include field size, year of production start-up, geological age, gravity, depth and depletion rate. The paper emphasizes the statistical analysis of reserve appreciation. It contrasts the Norwegian and {UK} experience. An important distinction is drawn between appreciation of oil-in-place and changes in recovery factors. North Sea oil reserve appreciation between production start-up and the last observation year (usually 1996) is found to be substantial, but generally lacks a consistent profile. Appreciation recorded for the Norwegian fields on average is considerably greater than for the {UK}. Most {UK} appreciation is seemingly accounted for by oil-in-place; in Norway, from increases in recovery factors. However, {UK} recovery factors commence at much higher levels than those for Norway.},

	abstract = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) to generalized cross-validation ({GCV}) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing {REML} or marginal likelihood ({ML}) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models ({GLMs}) use iterative {REML} or {ML} estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the {GLM}. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of {GCV}, or related criteria, for the {GLM} itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for {REML} or {ML} estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate {REML} or {ML} for any {GLM}, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This {REML} or {ML} criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for {GLM} fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The {REML} or {ML} criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new {REML} and {ML} methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to {GCV} or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and {GCV} are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as {GCV} or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous {REML}- or {ML}-based approaches for penalized {GLMs} and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

	abstract = {Penalized likelihood methods provide a range of practical modelling tools, including spline smoothing, generalized additive models and variants of ridge regression. Selecting the correct weights for penalties is a critical part of using these methods and in the single-penalty case the analyst has several well-founded techniques to choose from. However, many modelling problems suggest a formulation employing multiple penalties, and here general methodology is lacking. A wide family of models with multiple penalties can be fitted to data by iterative solution of the generalized ridge regression problem minimize {\textbar}{\textbar}W1/2 (Xp−y) {\textbar}{\textbar}2ρ+Σi=1m θip′Sip (p is a parameter vector, X a design matrix, Si a non-negative definite coefficient matrix defining the ith penalty with associated smoothing parameter θi, W a diagonal weight matrix, y a vector of data or pseudodata and ρ an ‘overall’ smoothing parameter included for computational efficiency). This paper shows how smoothing parameter selection can be performed efficiently by applying generalized cross-validation to this problem and how this allows non-linear, generalized linear and linear models to be fitted using multiple penalties, substantially increasing the scope of penalized modelling methods. Examples of non-linear modelling, generalized additive modelling and anisotropic smoothing are given.},

	abstract = {Despite their widespread use as predictors of the spot price of oil, oil futures prices tend to be less accurate in the mean-squared prediction error sense than no-change forecasts. This result is driven by the variability of the futures price about the spot price, as captured by the oil futures spread. This variability can be explained by the marginal convenience yield of oil inventories. Using a two-country, multi-period general equilibrium model of the spot and futures markets for crude oil we show that increased uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls under plausible assumptions causes the spread to decline. Increased uncertainty also causes precautionary demand for oil to increase, resulting in an immediate increase in the real spot price. Thus the negative of the oil futures spread may be viewed as an indicator of fluctuations in the price of crude oil driven by precautionary demand. An empirical analysis of this indicator provides evidence of how shifts in the uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls affect the real spot price of crude oil.

	abstract = {Summary. I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d ≥ 1 dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

In addition, estimates of total-factor productivity are corrected for measurement error that induces a procyclibal bias.
