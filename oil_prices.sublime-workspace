The theory was proposed for the first time by {M.K.} Hubbert in the 1950s as a way to describe the production pattern of crude oil. According to Hubbert, the production curve is “bell shaped” and approximately symmetric. Hubbert's theory was verified with good approximation for the case of oil production in the United States that peaked in 1971, and is now being applied to the worldwide oil production. It is generally believed that the global peak of oil production (“peak oil”) will take place during the first decade of the 21st century, and some analysts believe that it has already occurred in 2005 or 2006.

Economic models are reviewed more briefly. Forty-five mathematical models of oil depletion of the last century are classified along four dimensions of variability: emphasis on physical or economic aspects of oil production; model scale; hypothetical or mechanistic orientation; and complexity. Models based on quite disparate assumptions (e.g., physical simulation vs. economic optimal depletion) have produced approximately bell-shaped production profiles, but data do not support assertions that any one model type is most useful for forecasting future oil production. In fact, evidence suggests that existing models have fared poorly in predicting global oil production.

Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the future development of the giant oil fields will have a significant impact on the world oil supply. In order to better understand the giant fields and their future behavior, one must first understand their history. This study has used a comprehensive database on giant oil fields in order to determine their typical parameters, such as the average decline rate and life-times of giants. The evolution of giant oil field behavior has been investigated to better understand future behavior. One conclusion is that new technology and production methods have generally led to high depletion rates and rapid decline. The historical trend points towards high decline rates of fields currently on plateau production. The peak production generally occurs before half the ultimate reserves have been produced in giant oil fields. A strong correlation between depletion-at-peak and average decline rate is also found, verifying that high depletion rate leads to rapid decline.

Concern about the effect of this dependence on economic and national security has focused attention on the domestic resource base: how much oil awaits discovery and at what rate can it be produced? We analyze the adequacy of domestic resources by updating and modifying in important new ways the models of discovery and production developed by M. King Hubbert. Hubbert's models have been a lightning rod for debate about the future of oil resources because they have been the most accurate on record. When we include real oil prices and the annual rate of drilling effort in Hubbert's model of oil discovery, there is no evidence for claims that the secular decline in discoveries per foot of well drilled has been arrested or reversed in the lower forty-eight states. Our results indicate that there is little oil waiting to be found in unexplored sedimentary formations in the lower forty-eight states using conventional exploration techniques. Furthermore, we show that the declining quality of the resource base has offset the positive stimuli of price increases and changes in government policy towards a free market. Having passed through a period in which production in the lower forty-eight states fell 20 percent while real oil prices tripled there seems little that the {U.S.} government can do to alter the bottom line for domestic operators so that {U.S.} production can displace imports to a significant degree.

It begins with the study of the geology of an area followed by exploratory or wildcat drilling in promising areas. How much oil or gas is found or the supply of new reserves is a function of exploration, the geology of the area drilled along with a random component measuring the fickleness of mother nature in yielding up her treasures to mere mortals. Knowing how oil and gas prices affect this process (price elasticities) is valuable to those who are involved with this strategic industry. Economic theory suggests that the search for petroleum is affected by prices and can be characterized by functions representing geophysical activities and drilling while the finding of reserves can be characterized by some sort of discovery process. The earliest econometric approach to modeling oil and gas exploration, which yielded price elasticities, was to estimate the search process using a function for wildcat wells drilled (Ww). For example, the discovery process for oil was represented using two equations: a success rate equation \\% of wells that are commercially successful ({W/Ww)} and an average oil reserve per successful well equation ({O/W).} Each of these three dependent variables were dependent on price and other relevant variables. The product of these three variables ({Ww∗W/Ww∗O/W)} yields the supply of oil reserves (O). In this paper we survey all {U.S.} exploration models for oil and gas that include wells drilled, share of successful wells, average reserves per well, or total reserve equations. We focus our survey on price elasticities to capture the effect of market price on the exploration process. Drilling equation results tend to be good with drilling strongly influenced by oil price and we suspect the long run drilling oil price elasticity to be greated than 1. It is much less clear how natural gas prices have affected drilling but their effect seems to be increasing. The most important issue in drilling equations besides including the correct economic variables is more work to clarify what geological variables provide the best forecasts. The econometric estimates for successful wells and average reserves per wells are much poorer and we would recommend more systematic work on discovery models to determine which perform the best.},\n	number = {2},\n	urldate = {2013-11-05},\n	journal = {Journal of Energy Finance \\& Development},\n	author = {Dahl, Carol and Duggan, Thomas E.},\n	year = {1998},\n	pages = {129--169},\n	file = {ScienceDirect Full Text PDF:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/BGSKJDNH/Dahl and Duggan - 1998 - Survey of price elasticities from economic explora.pdf:application/pdf;ScienceDirect Snapshot:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/2FEA3GGU/S1085744399800726.html:text/html}\n},\n\n@article{forbes_technology_2002,\n	title = {Technology and the exploratory success rate in the {U.S.} onshore},\n	volume = {42},\n	issn = {1062-9769},\n	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106297690200128X},\n	doi = {10.1016/S1062-9769(02)00128-X},\n	abstract = {According to the Energy Information Administration, the exploratory success rate in the {U.S.} onshore increased to 34.2\\% in 1998 from 27.5\\% in 1978.

We estimate a vector error correction model for oil production in the lower 48 states that specifies real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing by the Texas Railroad Commission. These modifications enable us to generate a model that accounts for most of the variation in oil production in the lower 48 states between 1938 and 1991. The result that oil production in the lower 48 states shares stochastic trends with real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing indicates that accuracy of Hubbert's bell shaped curve is fortuitous. The importance of these factors also indicates why the basic Hotelling model cannot replicate the production path for oil in the lower 48 states. This inability is critical. The negative economic effects associated with high prices and energy shortages imply that the importance of inconsistencies with the basic Hotelling model identified by this analysis may be sufficient to warrant a greater degree of government intervention in the transition from oil than is currently envisioned by most policy makers.},\n	number = {Number 1},\n	urldate = {2013-11-05},\n	journal = {The Energy Journal},\n	author = {Kaufmann, Robert K. and Cleveland, Cutler J.},\n	year = {2001},\n	pages = {27--49},\n	file = {Kaufmand and Cleveland 2001.pdf:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/I2IGJUAE/Kaufmand and Cleveland 2001.pdf:application/pdf;RePEc Snapshot:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/XIBUAKG6/2001v22-01-a02.html:text/html}\n},\n\n@article{krautkraemer_nonrenewable_1998,\n	title = {Nonrenewable Resource Scarcity},\n	volume = {36},\n	copyright = {Copyright © 1998 American Economic Association},\n	issn = {0022-0515},\n	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2565047},\n	number = {4},\n	urldate = {2013-11-05},\n	journal = {Journal of Economic Literature},\n	author = {Krautkraemer, Jeffrey A.},\n	month = dec,\n	year = {1998},\n	note = {{ArticleType:} research-article / Full publication date: Dec., 1998 / Copyright © 1998 American Economic Association},\n	pages = {2065--2107},\n	file = {JSTOR Full Text PDF:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/AEETKDS8/Krautkraemer - 1998 - Nonrenewable Resource Scarcity.pdf:application/pdf}\n},\n\n@article{lynch_forecasting_2002,\n	title = {Forecasting oil supply: theory and practice},\n	volume = {42},\n	issn = {1062-9769},\n	shorttitle = {Forecasting oil supply},\n	url = {http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeequaeco/v_3a42_3ay_3a2002_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a373-389.htm},\n	number = {2},\n	urldate = {2013-11-05},\n	journal = {The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance},\n	author = {Lynch, Michael C.},\n	year = {2002},\n	pages = {373--389},\n	file = {RePEc Snapshot:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/GK7BVH99/v_3a42_3ay_3a2002_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a373-389.html:text/html}\n},\n\n@article{managi_technological_2005,\n	title = {Technological change and petroleum exploration in the Gulf of Mexico},\n	volume = {33},\n	issn = {0301-4215},\n	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421503002842},\n	doi = {10.1016/j.enpol.2003.09.007},\n	abstract = {We examine the impact of technological change on oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico from 1947 to 1998, using a unique micro-data set.

Using a trend of cumulative production, instead of time, will help to better fix the supply elasticity with respect to price, which is shown to be very inelastic.

These include field size, year of production start-up, geological age, gravity, depth and depletion rate. The paper emphasizes the statistical analysis of reserve appreciation. It contrasts the Norwegian and {UK} experience. An important distinction is drawn between appreciation of oil-in-place and changes in recovery factors. North Sea oil reserve appreciation between production start-up and the last observation year (usually 1996) is found to be substantial, but generally lacks a consistent profile. Appreciation recorded for the Norwegian fields on average is considerably greater than for the {UK.} Most {UK} appreciation is seemingly accounted for by oil-in-place; in Norway, from increases in recovery factors.

Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood ({REML)} to generalized cross-validation ({GCV)} for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing {REML} or marginal likelihood ({ML)} based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models ({GLMs)} use iterative {REML} or {ML} estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the {GLM.} Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of {GCV}, or related criteria, for the {GLM} itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for {REML} or {ML} estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate {REML} or {ML} for any {GLM}, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This {REML} or {ML} criterion requires that {Newton–Raphson} iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for {GLM} fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The {REML} or {ML} criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new {REML} and {ML} methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to {GCV} or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and {GCV} are prone.

Selecting the correct weights for penalties is a critical part of using these methods and in the single-penalty case the analyst has several well-founded techniques to choose from.

This result is driven by the variability of the futures price about the spot price, as captured by the oil futures spread. This variability can be explained by the marginal convenience yield of oil inventories. Using a two-country, multi-period general equilibrium model of the spot and futures markets for crude oil we show that increased uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls under plausible assumptions causes the spread to decline. Increased uncertainty also causes precautionary demand for oil to increase, resulting in an immediate increase in the real spot price. Thus the negative of the oil futures spread may be viewed as an indicator of fluctuations in the price of crude oil driven by precautionary demand. An empirical analysis of this indicator provides evidence of how shifts in the uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls affect the real spot price of crude oil.

I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d ≥ 1 dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},\n	language = {en},\n	number = {1},\n	urldate = {2013-11-19},\n	journal = {Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology)},\n	author = {Wood, Simon N.},\n	year = {2003},\n	keywords = {Generalized additive model, Regression spline, Thin plate spline},\n	pages = {95–114},\n	file = {Snapshot:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/AFIZ5MVJ/abstract.html:text/html}\n},\n\n@book{mohn_investment_2008,\n	series = {{Ph.D} Dissertation},\n	title = {Investment Behaviour in the  International Oil and Gas Industry},\n	publisher = {University of Stavanger},\n	author = {Mohn, Klaus},\n	year = {2008},\n	file = {Klaus Mohn PhD Thesis.pdf:/Users/johannesmauritzen/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/y2oiwf2h.default/zotero/storage/3D6V638X/Klaus Mohn PhD Thesis.pdf:application/pdf}\n},\n\n@article{pesaran_econometric_1990,\n	title = {An Econometric Analysis of Exploration and Extraction of Oil in the {U.K.} Continental Shelf},\n	volume = {100},\n	copyright = {Copyright © 1990 Royal Economic Society},\n	issn = {0013-0133},\n	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2234130},\n	doi = {10.2307/2234130},\n	number = {401},\n	urldate = {2014-01-14},\n	journal = {The Economic Journal},\n	author = {Pesaran, M.

In addition, estimates of total-factor productivity are corrected for measurement error that induces a procyclibal bias.
